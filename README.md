# kbdmatrixtext
Arduino USB keyboard and LED Matrix

The Adafruit NeoMatrix matrixtest example program scrolls text on an LED grid.
To change the text, the program source code must be changed and  uploaded. The
kbdmatrixtext program adds USB keyboard input to the matrixtest program so the
scrolling text can be changed by entering text via USB keyboard.  The program
has been tested on an Arduino Due using its USB native port in host mode.
